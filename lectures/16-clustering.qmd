## Announcements, previously, and today...

**HW5 is due TONIGHT by 11:59 PM ET**

**You have Lab 7 this Friday**

**HW6 is due next Wednesday March 26th by 11:59 PM ET**

**Last time:** General approach for visualizing distance matrices

- Puts $n$ observations in a $k$-dimensional space such that the distances are preserved as much as possible

  - where $k << p$ typically choose $k = 2$
  
MDS attempts to create new point $\boldsymbol{y}_i = (y_{i1}, y_{i2})$ for each unit such that:

$$\sqrt{(y_{i1} - y_{j1})^2 + (y_{i2} - y_{j2})^2} \approx D_{ij}$$

- i.e., distance in 2D MDS world is approximately equal to the actual distance

**Then plot the new $\boldsymbol{y}$s on a scatterplot**

- Use the `scale()` function to ensure variables are comparable

- Make a distance matrix for this dataset

- Visualize it with MDS

## Demo: [MCU movie data](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/which-is-the-best-performing-marvel-movie/)

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| attr-output: "style='font-size: 0.5em;'"
mcu_movies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/DataViz-Class-Data/main/mcu_movies.csv")
mcu_movies
```


---

## MCU meets MDS

```{r}
#| output-location: slide
mcu_quant <- mcu_movies |> dplyr::select(-c(film, category, year))

mcu_quant <- apply(mcu_quant, MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x) x / sd(x))
rownames(mcu_quant) <- mcu_movies$film

mcu_dist <- dist(mcu_quant)
mcu_mds <- cmdscale(d = dist(mcu_quant), k = 2)
mcu_movies <- mcu_movies |> mutate(mds1 = mcu_mds[,1], mds2 = mcu_mds[,2])

mcu_movies |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mds1, y = mds2)) +
  # Use text labels instead of points:
  geom_text(aes(label = film), alpha = .75) +
  labs(x = "MDS Coordinate 1", y = "MDS Coordinate 2") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Other ways to visualize distances and clusters

MDS can be a great way to visualize distances and identify clusters...

- However, requires picking certain variables that identify clusters well

**Is there a way to automatically identify clusters in the dataset?**

. . .

- Dendrograms are a nice way to visualize distances 

- _Automatically_ clusters different units together based on distance

$$\overbrace{\text{Dendro}}^{\text{tree}}\underbrace{\text{gram}}_{\text{drawing}}$$

First, let's look at dendrograms and learn how to interpret them - then we'll discuss how they're made

- Observations that are _closer_ together are on the same branch

- Doesn't tell you how many clusters there are, but does tell you which observations are clustered together

- For now: What is the computer doing to make dendrograms?

## (Agglomerative) [Hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering)

Let's pretend all $N$ observations are in their own cluster

Step 1: Compute the pairwise dissimilarities between each cluster

 - e.g., distance matrix on previous slides
  
. . .
  
Step 2: Identify the pair of clusters that are __least dissimilar__

. . .

Step 3: Fuse these two clusters into a new cluster!

. . .

__Repeat Steps 1 to 3 until all observations are in the same cluster__

__"Bottom-up"__, agglomerative clustering that forms a __tree / hierarchy__ of merging

## How do we define dissimilarity between clusters?

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

We know how to compute distance / dissimilarity between two observations

__But how do we handle clusters?__

  - Dissimilarity between a cluster and an observation, or between two clusters
  
:::
  
. . .

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

We need to choose a __linkage function__! Clusters are built up by __linking them together__

Compute all pairwise dissimilarities between observations in cluster 1 with observations in cluster 2

i.e. Compute the distance matrix between observations, $d(x_i, x_j)$ for $i \in C_1$ and $j \in C_2$

:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

  - __Complete linkage__: Use the __maximum__ value of these dissimilarities: $\underset{i \in C_1, j \in C_2}{\text{max}} d(x_i, x_j)$

  - __Single linkage__: Use the __minimum__ value: $\underset{i \in C_1, j \in C_2}{\text{min}} d(x_i, x_j)$

  - __Average linkage__: Use the __average__ value: $\frac{1}{|C_1| \cdot |C_2|} \sum_{i \in C_1} \sum_{j \in C_2} d(x_i, x_j)$


Define dissimilarity between two clusters __based on our initial dissimilarity matrix between observations__

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
hc_complete <- hclust(mcu_dist, method = "complete")
plot(hc_complete, ylab = "Pairwise Distance", main = "Complete Linkage", xlab = "MCU Movies")
```


---

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
hc_single <- hclust(mcu_dist, method = "single")
plot(hc_single, ylab = "Pairwise Distance", main = "Single Linkage", xlab = "MCU Movies")
```


---

## [`ggdendro` version](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdendro/vignettes/ggdendro.html)

```{r}
library(ggdendro)
ggdendrogram(hc_complete, theme_dendro = FALSE) + #<<
  labs(y = "Cluster Dissimilarity (based on complete linkage)", 
       title = "Which MCU movies are similar to each other?") + 
  coord_flip() + theme_bw() + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
```


---

## Display MDS plot with dendrogram side-by-side

```{r}
#| output-location: slide
library(patchwork)
hc_complete_ggdendro <- ggdendrogram(hc_complete, theme_dendro = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Cluster Dissimilarity (based on complete linkage)", 
       title = "Which MCU movies are similar to each other?") + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  # Remove the y-axis title (changed from x to y since we flipped it!)
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10))

mcu_mds_plot <- mcu_movies |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mds1, y = mds2)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = film),
            alpha = .75, size = 2) +
  labs(x = "MDS Coordinate 1", y = "MDS Coordinate 2") +
  theme_bw()

mcu_mds_plot + hc_complete_ggdendro
```

## How do we assign cluster labels?

**We cut the dendrogram to return cluster labels**

Two ways to specify how to cut the tree using the `cutree` function:

1) via the height using `h`, e.g., cut the tree at height = 10

```{r}
#| eval: false
cutree(hc_complete, h = 10)
```

. . .

2) via the desired number of clusters `k` - and let the computer figure out the height for us, e.g., `k = 2`

```{r}
#| eval: false
cutree(hc_complete, k = 2)
```


---

```{r}
#| attr-output: "style='font-size: 0.5em;'"
mcu_clusters <- cutree(hc_complete, h = 10)
mcu_clusters
```

---

## View results with cut on dendrogram

```{r}
#| output-location: slide
cut_dendro <- hc_complete_ggdendro +
  # This is a horizontal line since its considered before the flip:
  geom_hline(yintercept = 10, linetype = "dashed", 
             color = "darkred")

cluster_mcu_mds_plot <- mcu_movies |>
  mutate(cluster = as.factor(mcu_clusters)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mds1, y = mds2,
             color = cluster)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = film),
            alpha = .75, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "MDS Coordinate 1", y = "MDS Coordinate 2") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

cluster_mcu_mds_plot + cut_dendro
```

## [`factoextra` package](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/index.html) version

```{r}
#| warning: false

## Recap and next steps

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

+ Dendrograms are a great way to visualize distances and the clustering structure in the dataset

+ However there are several decisions to be made! 

+ *What type of linkage is appropriate for the problem?*

+ *How do we [choose the number of clusters](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/determining-the-optimal-number-of-clusters-3-must-know-methods/)?*

**There is NOT a one size fits all solution to any of this!**
