## Announcements, previously, and today...

+ **Complete HW0 by tonight!** Confirms you have everything installed and can [render `.qmd` files to PDF via `tinytex`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html)

+ Office hours will be announced soon... (I'll be in my office BH 132D today at 2:30 PM)

. . .

+ Discussed the importance of data visualization in your role as a statistician / data scientist

+ Introduced the **Grammar of Graphics** as a framework for building visualizations

+ Discussed historical examples and principles of visualization to keep in mind

. . .

**TODAY: 1D Categorical Data**

+ Briefly talk about variable types

+ Walk through different graphs for visualizing 1D categorical data

---

## Reminder: `tidy` data structure

Data are often stored in __tabular__ (or matrix) form:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |> slice(1:5)
```

+ Each row `==` unit of observation, e.g., penguins

+ Each column `==` variable/measurement about each observation, e.g., `flipper_length_mm`

+ Known as a `data.frame` in base `R` and `tibble` in the `tidyverse`

+ Two main variable types: quantitative and categorical

---

## Variable Types

+ Most visualizations are about understanding the distribution of different variables (which are stored in columns of tabular/matrix data)

+ The __variable type__ often dictates the type of graphs you should make

+ There are two main types of variables:

<!--

1. __Quantitative__

  + Discrete (i.e., counts, usually recorded as whole numbers), examples: number of likes/retweets, number of times word is used
  
  + Continuous (any real number), examples: income, age, miles run, heart rate
  
  + In `R` these are usually classified as `integer` or `numeric`
  

2. __Categorical__

Today: Discuss what to do when you have a single column of categorical data (i.e., 1D categorical data)

-->

## 1D Categorical Data

Two different versions of categorical:

1. **Nominal**: coded with arbitrary numbers, i.e., no real order

+ Examples: race, gender, species, text

. . .

2. **Ordinal**: levels with a meaningful order

+ Examples: education level, grades, ranks
  
. . .

__NOTE__: `R` and `ggplot` considers a categorical variable to be `factor`

+ `R` will always treat categorical variables as ordinal! Defaults to alphabetical...
  
+ We will need to manually define the `factor` levels

---

## 1D categorical data structure

+ Observations are collected into a vector $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$, where $n$ is number of observations

+ Each observed value $x_i$ can only belong to one category level $\{ C_1, C_2, \dots \}$

. . .

Look at `penguins` data from the [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package, focusing on `species`:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins$species)
```

***How could we summarize these data? What information would you report?***

. . .

```{r}
table(penguins$species)
```

---

## Area plots

![](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/directory_of_visualizations_files/figure-html/proportions-1.png){fig-align="center" width=65%}

+ Each area corresponds to one categorical level

+ Area is proportional to counts/frequencies/percentages

+ Differences between areas correspond to differences between counts/frequencies/percentages


---

## Bar charts

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3-4"
library(tidyverse)
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar()
```



---

## Behind the scenes: statistical summaries

From [Chapter 3 of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)

## Spine charts - height version

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(fill = species, x = "")) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

## Spine charts - width version

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(fill = species, x = "")) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

---

## So you want to make pie charts...

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2-5"
penguins |> 
  ggplot(aes(fill = species, x = "")) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count))) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_void() 
```

---

## [Waffle charts](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle) are cooler anyway...

```{r}
library(waffle)
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") |> 
  ggplot(aes(fill = species, values = count)) +
  geom_waffle(n_rows = 20, color = "white", flip = TRUE) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```

## Rose diagrams

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2-5"
penguins |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = species)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "darkblue") +
  coord_polar() +
  scale_y_sqrt()
```

## Recap and next steps

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}


+ 1D Categorical Data: look at counts, frequencies, percentages

+ Area plots, where area $\propto$ counts/frequencies/percentages:

  + __Bar charts (you should pretty much always just make a bar chart)__
  
  + Spine charts (will be more useful with more variables)
  
  + Pie charts (__DON'T DO IT__)
  
  + Rose diagrams (temporal or directional context can justify usage)
