    "text": "Working with penguins\nIn R, there are many libraries or packages/groups of programs that are not permanently stored in R, so we have to load them when we want to use them. You can load an R package by typing library(package_name). (Sometimes we need to download/install the package first, as described in HW0.)\nThroughout this demo we will use the palmerpenguins dataset. To access the data, you will need to install the palmerpenguins package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\n\nImport the penguins dataset by loading the palmerpenguins package using the library function and then access the data with the data() function:\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins) \ndata(penguins)\n\nView some basic info about the penguins dataset:\n\n# displays same info as c(nrow(penguins), ncol(penguins))\ndim(penguins) \n\n[1] 344   8\n\nclass(penguins)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\ntbl (pronounced tibble) is the tidyverse way of storing tabular data, like a spreadsheet or data.frame\nI assure you that you’ll run into errors as you code in R; in fact, my attitude as a coder is that something is wrong if I never get any errors while working on a project. When you run into an error, your first reaction may be to panic and post a question to Piazza. However, checking help documentation in R can be a great way to figure out what’s going wrong. (For good or bad, I end up having to read help documentation almost every day of my life - because, well, I regularly make mistakes in R.)\nLook at the help documentation for penguins by typing help(penguins) in the Console. What are the names of the variables in this dataset? How many observations are in this dataset?\n\nhelp(penguins)\n\nYou should always look at your data before doing anything: view the first 6 (by default) rows with head()\n\nhead(penguins) # Try just typing penguins into your console, what happens?\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nIs our penguins dataset tidy?\n\nEach row = a single penguin\nEach column = different measurement about the penguins (can print out column names directly with colnames(penguins) or names(penguins))\n\nWe’ll now explore differences among the penguins using the tidyverse."

Warning messages will tell you when other packages that are loaded may have functions replaced with the most recent package you’ve loaded. In general though, you should just be concerned when an error message pops up (errors are different than warnings!).\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.0     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWe’ll start by summarizing continuous (e.g., bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm) and categorical (e.g., species, island) variables in different ways.\nWe can compute summary statistics for continuous variables with the summary() function:\n\nsummary(penguins$bill_length_mm)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Within the tidyverse, dplyr is a package with functions for data wrangling (because it’s within the tidyverse that means you do NOT have to load it separately with library(dplyr) after using library(tidyverse)!). It’s considered a “grammar of data manipulation”: dplyr functions are verbs, datasets are nouns.\nWe can filter() our dataset to choose observations meeting conditions:\n\nclean_penguins &lt;- filter(penguins, !is.na(bill_length_mm))\n# Use help(is.na) to see what it returns.
